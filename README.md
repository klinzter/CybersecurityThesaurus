# CybersecurityThesaurus
A program to create a thesaurus based on Tweets in a specific topic. For our research, we used over 40,000 Cybersecurity tweets gathered from experts in the field, but this can be easily changed to any category by changing the tweet corpus. 

This is a copy of the private repository where the code was originally written, with all Twitter API code removed for privacy.
